# This is an example of how this might be implemented with CircuitPython

import time
import board
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull

# create the analog inputs and outputs for this example. Ideally we want to use an input as an interrupt to wake engage the power switch
DATA_IN = AnalogIn(board.A0)
DATA_OUT = AnalogIn(board.A1)

# create a digitial output to control the power switch
POWERIO = DigitalInOut(board.D13)
# set the direction of the digital pin to output
POWERIO.direction = Direction.OUTPUT

# use this infinite while loop to constantly check the input of the analog pin.

    time.sleep(0.01)
    DATA_OUT.value = DATA_IN * 10
